    "## Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This research study is analyzing how different levels of development impact a country's progress towards sustainability, more specifically towards clean energy. The intent of this study is to explore whether developed nations tend to adopt more sustainable practices or whether their high consumption patterns counteract these efforts. As global warming is increasingly impacting our lives and environment more each day, it is important we evaluate how effectively countries are managing their resources and consider ways we can make environmental changes ourselves. This analysis studies the relationship between how sustainability varies across different stages of development, demonstrating whether developed countries are utilizing their resources responsibly or if their consumption patterns have harmful environmental consequences. One of the questions that will be explored is, *are developed countries more likely to have higher percentages of renewable energy consumption compared to developing or underdeveloped countries?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Countries with higher GDP levels and greater development will show a positive correlation with higher renewable energy consumption.  "

    "Previous research have also explored the relationship between economic development and environment impacts. The Environment Kuznet Curve suggests that pollution rises in early stages of development, then falls as economies mature and prioritize environmental protection. Their hypothesis creates an inverted U-shaped trend, where as a country first develops economically, environmental degradation increases with the rising income, but it reaches a turning point and begins to decrease, creating an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and environmental quality. From this information, I want to explore further in depth and explore how countries at different stages of development manage their energy consumption and environmental impacts. I want to specifically investigate whether more developed countries, which should theoretically have the resources and policies to promote sustainability, are truly adopting renewable energy practices or whether their high energy consumption patterns hinder environmental progress. \n",

    "### Data Collected\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the datasets that was used for the analysis comes from the World Development Indicators (WDI) - World Bank site. From this site, there are various datasets that can be obtained from the World Bank. It includes a comprehensive set of series across many countries that can determine the development of a country. The set of series covers data on GDP, Human Development Index (HDI), poverty levels, literacy rates, and access to resources. This site provides quantitative data into the economic and social development levels of numerous countries. For this analysis, the Gross Domestic Product (current US$) data sets was used and compared amongst different countries to determine their development levels. Then, this dataset was used to find any correlations with the renewable energy consumption of countries. However, it is also important to note that some data may be outdated, missing, or inaccurate - particularly for low-income countries where reporting capabilities may be limited. This could potentially lead to skewed or mislearning conclusions about a countryâ€™s development or sustainable practices. \n",

    "\n",
    "Another data set that was used is the World Bank - Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) Database. This dataset offers series related to energy access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency across countries. It includes data on renewable energy consumption, electricity access, and clean fuel use. The Renewable Energy Consumption and Total Final Energy consumption datasets were used to compare the amount of renewable energy usage across countries. From doing this comparison, the relationship between levels of country development and clean energy usage were analyzed. With this dataset, investigation of whether developed countries are adopting more clean energy solutions or if their high consumption rates are creating more harm to the environment were explored. Similar to the WDI dataset, SE4ALL data may be limited for certain countries, especially those with lower income or underdeveloped energy infrastructure.\n",
