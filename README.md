## Country Development and Clean Energy Adoption Analysis 

## Project Overview

This research project explores the relationship between a country's development level and its progress towards clean energy adoption. By analyzing data from the World Development Indicators and Sustainable Energy for All databases, I will explore how development indicators, such as the GDP of a country, correlate with renewable energy consumption. Through a scatter plot data visualization, trends will be identified and illustrated to see the relationship between the level of development and clean energy consumption. This analysis will contribute to understanding the connection between economic growth and sustainable energy use.

## Project Goals 

The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether higher levels of economic development, as measured by GDP, are associated with greater adoption of renewable energy. By evaluating this relationship, the study aims to uncover trends that inform sustainable energy strategies and provide insights into how countries at different stages of development manage renewable energy resources. Ultimately, the findings will help identify potential opportunities for policy interventions and resource allocation to promote clean energy adoption globally.

## Key Resources
